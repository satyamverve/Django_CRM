# Django Admin Permisions:
From this we can make groups or individual also to give the permission of add, delete, change/update and view the app

perms.app_name.operation_model_name

here, operation = add, delete, change/update, view

and in this application we have model call Record
remember that always use all the name with perms in lowercase
